The Kyoto Protocol was adopted in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997 and came into force in 2005.
It sets legally binding emission reduction targets for dozens of industrialized countries and the European Community.
The treaty is built on the idea that developed countries bear greater responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions.
The United States refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol and was therefore never part of the agreement.
The first commitment period of Kyoto ran from 2008 to 2012 and a second period was created by the Doha Amendment to cover 2013 to 2020.
