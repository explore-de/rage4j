The Kyoto Protocol is an international treaty that was adopted on December 11, 1997, in Kyoto, Japan, and entered into force on February 16, 2005.
It commits 37 industrialized countries and the European Community to internationally binding emission reduction targets.
The treaty is based on the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities,” recognizing that developed countries are chiefly responsible for the current high levels of greenhouse gas emissions.
The United States signed the Kyoto Protocol but never ratified it, and therefore is not bound by its emission targets.
Kyoto’s first commitment period ran from 2008 to 2012 and was later extended by the Doha Amendment for a second period from 2013 to 2020.
