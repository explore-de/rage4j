The Hubble Space Telescope was launched into low Earth orbit by the Space Shuttle Discovery on April 24, 1990.
Operated by NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), Hubble has provided high-resolution images that have significantly advanced astronomy.
It observes primarily in the visible, ultraviolet, and near-infrared wavelengths.
Hubble’s instruments have been upgraded multiple times during servicing missions, extending its operational life well beyond initial expectations.
Scientists have used Hubble data to measure the rate of expansion of the universe with unprecedented precision.
