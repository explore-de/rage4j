The Hubble Space Telescope was launched into low Earth orbit in 1990.
It is operated jointly by NASA and the European Space Agency.
Hubble mainly observes in visible, ultraviolet, and radio wavelengths.
Astronauts have upgraded its instruments during servicing missions, which helped extend its operational life.
Scientists have used Hubble data to study the expansion rate of the universe.
