The Great Barrier Reef, located off the coast of Queensland, Australia, is the world’s largest coral reef system.
It is composed of over 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands stretching for more than 2,300 kilometres.
The reef supports a wide diversity of marine life, including many vulnerable and endangered species.
In recent decades, rising ocean temperatures have caused multiple mass coral bleaching events across the reef.
Australian authorities and scientists have launched conservation programs aimed at improving water quality and monitoring reef health.
