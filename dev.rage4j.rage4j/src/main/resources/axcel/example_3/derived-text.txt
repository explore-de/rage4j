The Great Barrier Reef is the largest coral reef system in the world and lies off the coast of Queensland, Australia.
It consists of thousands of individual reefs and hundreds of islands that extend for more than 2,000 kilometres.
The reef is home to a wide variety of marine life, including endangered species.
In recent decades, pollution has been the primary cause of mass coral bleaching events across the reef.
Australian scientists and government agencies have started conservation programs to improve water quality and track the health of the reef.
