# Rage4J

For specific information about individual parts of the system,
go to the respective README's in the folders.

## Requirements

To use/build rage4j you need to install yarn and java,
there are maven wrappers inside the individual modules
(`./mvnw`). Please use the exentra code formatter, and
(on VSCode) install the editorconfig extension (IntelliJ has
built-in support).
