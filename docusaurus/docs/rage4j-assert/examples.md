### Example: Testing Answer Correctness

``` JAVA
RageAssert rageAssert = new OpenAiLLMBuilder().fromApiKey(key);
rageAssert.given()
    .question(QUESTION)
    .groundTruth(GROUND_TRUTH)
    .when()
    .answer(model.generate(QUESTION))
    .then()
    .assertAnswerCorrectness(0.7);
```

This example demonstrates how to use the [`assertAnswerCorrectness`](/docs/rage4j-core/metrics/answer_correctness)
feature. It checks if the model's generated answer
meets a correctness threshold of 0.7 compared to the defined ground truth.

### Example: Testing Faithfulness

``` java
RageAssert rageAssert = new OpenAiLLMBuilder().fromApiKey(key);
rageAssert.given()
    .question(QUESTION)
    .groundTruth(GROUND_TRUTH)
    .contextList(List.of(ANSWER))
    .when()
    .answer(model::generate)
    .then()
    .assertFaithfulness(0.7);
```

This example illustrates the use of [`assertFaithfulness`](/docs/rage4j-core/metrics/faithfulness), ensuring that the
generated answer adheres to the provided
context and retains at least 0.7 faithfulness compared to the ground truth.

### Example: Testing Semantic Similarity

``` java
RageAssert rageAssert = new OpenAiLLMBuilder().fromApiKey(key);
rageAssert.given()
    .question(QUESTION)
    .groundTruth(GROUND_TRUTH)
    .when()
    .answer(model::generate)
    .then()
    .assertSemanticSimilarity(0.7);
```

In this example, [`assertSemanticSimilarity`](/docs/rage4j-core/metrics/answer_semantic_similarity)  is used to verify
that the
semantic similarity score between the model's
answer and the ground truth is at least 0.7.

### Example: Testing Answer Relevance

``` java
RageAssert rageAssert = new OpenAiLLMBuilder().fromApiKey(key);
rageAssert.given()
    .question(QUESTION)
    .groundTruth(GROUND_TRUTH)
    .contextList(CONTEXT)
    .when()
    .answer(model::generate)
    .then()
    .assertAnswerRelevance(0.7);
```

This example uses the [`assertAnswerRelevance`](/docs/rage4j-core/metrics/answer_relevance) feature, checking that the
model's answer is relevant to the context
provided, with a relevance score of at least 0.7.
